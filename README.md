Hi, I'm Grant

I am a DevOps Architect and a `Cloud Engineer`

 Learning new and challenging
things everyday is for me a fundamental part of my life. I love to share
my learnings, mentorship and co-creating magic is one of my core values.

I am passionate about Linux, DevOps, Automation and dogs. I love to
design, architect systems and frameworks throughout the entire sofware
development life-cycle. Fanatic proponent of Test Drive Development and
Infrastructure as Code to build out CI/CD pipelines for modern
containerized distributed systems. 

I am an avid maker and love to
conduct hack/make-a-thons. 

I have been coding for over two decades, and
been speaking for almost half of that. I speak all over to whomever will
listen. I code, empower, document, listen and learn, am engaged and engaging - often not in that exact sequence.

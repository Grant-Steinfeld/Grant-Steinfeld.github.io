> The idea of space is a very fundamental one for me. This is what draws me to carpentry, metalwork and landscape / gardening. This is also what draws me to how we organize the space for building systems architectures. Are our tools organized beautifully? I truly take pride in building developer productivity tools, even if they are command line programs, to be beautiful! Beautiful spaces are not just about the tools and things we can touch, it’s also about the space of our interactions, where constant curiosity, learning,mentoring and nurturing is an integral part of my core values.

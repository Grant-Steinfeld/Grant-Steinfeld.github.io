#Grant Steinfeld - Biography


> DevOps Architect, Cloud Engineer, primarily focusing on server-side technology, with a track record of building elegant yet robust spaces for scalable systems and collaborative innovation. I'm curious tinkerer, with experience in scalable architecture and breadth in all things technology and frameworks. Strong agile software design and development skills focusing on languages: Python, PowerShell, C#, TypeScript and JavaScript. Adept as an individual contributor as well as leading, managing and mentoring development teams.


> With over two decades experience, focus has been on backend systems – middleware and Enterprise Integration Patterns and databases are a core passion.  Early adopter and champion for Blockchain technologies, primarily permissioned private topologies. Administrator, advocate and SmartContract programmer in particular, Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.


> The idea of space is a very fundamental one for me. This is what draws me to carpentry, metalwork and landscaping. I'm fascinated with creating and building system architectures. I truly take pride in building developer productivity tools, even if they are command line programs. It's not just about the tools and things we can touch, it’s also about the space of our interactions, where constant curiosity, learning, mentoring and nurturing is an integral part of my core values.
